              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Sentio represents an innovative approach to child development support, leveraging artificial intelligence 
                to provide personalized guidance for neurotypical children facing common developmental challenges. Our 
                platform addresses the growing need for accessible, individualized support systems that can complement 
                traditional educational and therapeutic approaches.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                We recognize that each child's developmental journey is unique, requiring tailored interventions that 
                respect individual learning styles, emotional needs, and social contexts. Through evidence-based AI 
                interactions, we aim to foster resilience, self-awareness, and adaptive coping strategies in children 
                aged 6-16 years.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Theoretical Framework</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Our approach is grounded in several key developmental theories and research paradigms:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Social Cognitive Theory:</strong> Emphasizing the role of observational learning and self-efficacy in child development</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional Intelligence Framework:</strong> Building competencies in emotional awareness, regulation, and social skills</li>
                <li><strong>Positive Psychology Principles:</strong> Focusing on strengths-based interventions and resilience building</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive-Behavioral Approaches:</strong> Helping children understand the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                These theoretical foundations inform our AI's conversational strategies, ensuring that interactions are 
                not merely responsive but therapeutically informed and developmentally appropriate.
